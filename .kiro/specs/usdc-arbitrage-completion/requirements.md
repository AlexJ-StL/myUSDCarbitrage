# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for completing the USDC arbitrage backtesting application backend. The application enables users to backtest arbitrage strategies across multiple exchanges and timeframes using historical USDC price data. The system needs to be production-ready with comprehensive testing, monitoring, and security features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Pipeline Enhancement

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want reliable and complete historical data, so that my backtesting results are accurate and trustworthy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the data downloader runs THEN the system SHALL validate all OHLCV data integrity before storage
2. WHEN data gaps are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to fill gaps from alternative sources
3. WHEN new data is downloaded THEN the system SHALL perform incremental updates without duplicating existing records
4. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and alert administrators
5. IF data anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL flag suspicious records for manual review

### Requirement 2: Advanced Backtesting Engine

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to test sophisticated arbitrage strategies with realistic market conditions, so that I can evaluate strategy performance accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running a backtest THEN the system SHALL calculate comprehensive performance metrics including Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, maximum drawdown, and CAGR
2. WHEN executing trades in backtest THEN the system SHALL apply realistic transaction costs and slippage modeling
3. WHEN optimizing strategy parameters THEN the system SHALL support walk-forward optimization to prevent overfitting
4. WHEN comparing strategies THEN the system SHALL provide statistical significance testing
5. IF market conditions change THEN the system SHALL support regime-aware backtesting

### Requirement 3: Strategy Management System

**User Story:** As a strategy developer, I want to create, version, and manage multiple arbitrage strategies, so that I can systematically improve my trading approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new strategy THEN the system SHALL support multiple strategy types including threshold-based, ML-based, and statistical arbitrage
2. WHEN modifying a strategy THEN the system SHALL maintain version history and allow rollback to previous versions
3. WHEN deploying a strategy THEN the system SHALL validate strategy parameters and dependencies
4. WHEN strategies are running THEN the system SHALL monitor performance and alert on significant deviations
5. IF a strategy fails THEN the system SHALL automatically disable it and notify administrators

### Requirement 4: API Security and Authentication

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure API access with proper authentication and authorization, so that sensitive trading data is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the API THEN the system SHALL require JWT-based authentication
2. WHEN performing sensitive operations THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access control
3. WHEN API requests exceed limits THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS encryption for all communications
5. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log security events and alert administrators

### Requirement 5: Real-time Monitoring and Alerting

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring of system health and performance, so that I can proactively address issues before they impact trading operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system components are running THEN the system SHALL monitor CPU, memory, and database performance metrics
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts via email and SMS
3. WHEN data feeds fail THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt failover to backup sources
4. WHEN backtests complete THEN the system SHALL generate automated performance reports
5. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL implement auto-scaling capabilities

### Requirement 6: Production Deployment Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want containerized deployment with CI/CD pipelines, so that the application can be reliably deployed and maintained in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL use Docker containers for consistent environments
2. WHEN code changes are committed THEN the system SHALL automatically run tests and deploy if successful
3. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling with load balancing
4. WHEN backups are required THEN the system SHALL automatically backup database and configuration data
5. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback to the previous stable version

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a software developer, I want extensive test coverage with automated testing, so that code changes don't introduce regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL maintain >90% test coverage across all modules
2. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
3. WHEN edge cases occur THEN the system SHALL have specific tests for error conditions and boundary cases
4. WHEN performance is critical THEN the system SHALL include load testing and stress testing
5. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and notify developers

### Requirement 8: Advanced Analytics and Reporting

**User Story:** As a portfolio manager, I want detailed analytics and visualizations of strategy performance, so that I can make informed investment decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing results THEN the system SHALL provide interactive charts and graphs of strategy performance
2. WHEN analyzing risk THEN the system SHALL calculate Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall metrics
3. WHEN comparing periods THEN the system SHALL support rolling window analysis and regime detection
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL export results in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, JSON)
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically flag strategies requiring attention
