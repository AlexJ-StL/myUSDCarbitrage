   - Added horizontal pod autoscaling based on CPU and memory usage
   - Created service mesh configuration for inter-service communication

2. **Task 9.2: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation**
   - Created GitHub Actions workflow with automated testing and deployment
   - Implemented staged deployment with blue-green deployment strategy
   - Added automated rollback mechanisms on deployment failures
   - Created infrastructure as code using Terraform

3. **Task 9.3: Database and Storage Optimization**
   - Implemented TimescaleDB compression policies for historical data
   - Created automated backup and recovery procedures
   - Added database connection pooling and query optimization
   - Implemented data archiving strategy for long-term storage

## Test Results

The tests are currently failing due to missing dependencies. To run the tests successfully, the following dependencies need to be installed:

- redis
- tenacity
- psutil

Additionally, there are some import errors in the test files that need to be fixed:

- `GapInfo` is missing from `api.gap_alerting`
- `format_currency` is missing from `reporting.jinja_filters`

## Next Steps

1. Fix the missing dependencies and import errors in the test files
2. Run the tests to ensure all functionality is working correctly
3. Update the documentation with more detailed instructions
4. Consider adding more examples and usage scenarios
